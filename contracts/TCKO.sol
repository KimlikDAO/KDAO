/**
 * @title TCKO: KimlikDAO Token
 *
 * Utility
 * =======
 * 1 TCKO represents a share of all assets of the KimlikDAO treasury located
 * at `kimlikdao.eth` and 1 voting right for all treasury investment decisions.
 *
 * Any TCKO holder can redeem their share of the DAO treasury assets by
 * transferring their TCKOs to `kimlikdao.eth` on Avalanche C-chain. Such a
 * transfer burns the transferred TCKOs and sends the redeemer their share of
 * the treasury. The share of the redeemer is `sentAmount / totalSupply()`
 * fraction of all the ERC20 tokens and AVAX the treasury has.
 * Note however that the market value TCKO is ought to be higher than the
 * redemption amount, as TCKO represents a share in KimlikDAO's future cash
 * flow as well. The redemption amount is merely a lower bound on TCKOs value
 * and this functionality should only be used as a last resort.
 *
 * Investment decisions are made through proposals to swap some treasury assets
 * to other assets on a DEX, which are voted on-chain by all TCKO holders.
 *
 * Combined with a TCKT, TCKO gives a person voting rights for non-financial
 * decisions of KimlikDAO also; however in such decisions the voting weight is
 * not necessarily proportional to one's TCKO holdings (guaranteed to be
 * sub-linear in one's TCKO holdings). Since TCKT is an ID token, it allows us
 * to enforce the sub-linear voting weight.
 *
 * Supply Cap
 * ==========
 * There will be 100M TCKOs minted ever, distributed over 5 rounds of 20M TCKOs
 * each.
 *
 * Inside the contract, we keep track of another variable `distroStage`, which
 * ranges between 0 and 7 inclusive, and can be mapped to the `distroRound` as
 * follows.
 *
 *   distroRound :=  distroStage / 2 + (distroStage == 0 ? 1 : 2)
 *
 * The `distroStage` has 8 values, corresponding to the beginning and the
 * ending of the 5 distribution rounds; see `DistroStage` enum.
 * The `distroStage` can only be incremented, and only by `dev.kimlikdao.eth`
 * by calling the `incrementDistroStage()` method of this contract.
 *
 * In distribution rounds 3 and 4, 20M TCKOs are minted to `kimlikdao.eth`
 * automatically, to be sold / distributed to the public by `kimlikdao.eth`.
 * In the rest of the rounds (1, 2, and 5), the minting is manually managed
 * by `dev.kimlikdao.eth`, however the total minted TCKOs is capped at
 * distroRound * 20M TCKOs at any moment during the lifetime of the contract.
 * Additionally, in round 2, the `presale2Contract` is also given minting
 * rights, again respecting the 20M * distroRound supply cap.
 *
 * Since the `releaseRound` cannot be incremented beyond 5, this ensures that
 * there can be at most 100M TCKOs minted.
 *
 * Locking
 * =======
 * Each mint to external parties results in some unlocked and some locked
 * TCKOs, and the ratio is fixed globally. Only the 40M TCKOs minted to
 * `kimlikdao.eth` across rounds 3 and 4 are fully unlocked.
 *
 * The unlocking schedule is as follows:
 *
 *  /------------------------------------
 *  | Minted in round  |  Unlock time
 *  |------------------------------------
 *  |   Round 1        |  End of round 3
 *  |   Round 2        |  End of round 4
 *  |   Round 3        |  Unlocked
 *  |   Round 4        |  Unlocked
 *  |   Round 5        |  Year 2028
 *
 * Define:
 *   (D1) distroRound := distroStage / 2 + (distroStage == 0 ? 1 : 2)
 *
 * Facts:
 *   (F1) 1 <= distroRound <= 5
 *
 * Invariants:
 *   (I1) supplyCap() <= 20M * 1M * distroRound
 *   (I2) sum_a(balanceOf[a]) == totalSupply <= totalMinted
 *   (I3) totalMinted <= supplyCap()
 *   (I4) balanceOf[KILITLI_TCKO] == KilitliTCKO.totalSupply()
 *
 * (F1) follows because DistroStage has 8 values and floor(7/2) + 2 = 5.
 * Combining (F1) and (I1) gives the 100M TCKO supply cap.
